## Summary
I am almost 30 years old and I am a specialist in customs clearance. In the past 2 years, I realized that this is not what I want to do all my life. My current work is not associated with constant self-development. Most of my tasks are trivial.     
I like to be immerse into a task and to look for solution. Especially if it is connected with the learning of something new. I am a meticulous person by nature, so I am not afraid of a job that requires concentration for hours. This is confirmed by the fact that I studied HTML, CSS and javascript by myself at a sufficient level to build some web pages.  
I realized that this work suits my temperament. I like to find the most elegant solutions to improve the result. I often notice shortcomings on web sites and I have thoughts on how this can be improved.  
I believe that one of the important goals in life is continuous development. Front end development keeps mind in good shape.  
My goal is to fulfill oneself through work. I want to feel like a sought after specialist with decent pay and enjoy the work in promising and developing area. The front end development is an sphere where I could achieve these goals. My immediate goal is to become a front-end developer and gain experience solving practical problems.
